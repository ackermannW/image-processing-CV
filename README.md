# Digital image processing in OpenCV using Python

This repository shows usage of OpenCV Python package for 
digital image processing. 

## Setup

1. Create conda environment:

``` sh
conda create --name digital-image-processing python==3.8
```
2. Change active environment:

``` sh
conda activate digital-image-processing
```

3. Clone the repository:

``` sh 
git clone https://github.com/ackermannW/image-processing-CV    
```

4. Navigate to the repository and install ``` pip ``` packages from ``` requirements.txt ```

``` sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
